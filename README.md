# Socket Calculator

This project was built for my Internet Protocols class. It's a Client-Server communication protocol that performs simple calculator operations (addition, substraction, multiplication and division) running on localhost on a random port (12006). 

## How to use

First, run the TCPServer.py script and while it's running, run the TCPClient.py script and enter the input for the operation you wish to execute.
